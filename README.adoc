= Vert.x 3.1 Simplest Gradle project

This project shows a very simple hello world Vert.x 3.1 project using Gradle, which has a simple HTTP server which
simply returns "Hello World!" to every request.

In this example Vert.x is used embedded. I.e. we use the Vert.x APIs directly in our own classes rather than deploying
the code in verticles.

You can run or debug the example in your IDE by just right clicking the main class and run as.. or debug as...

Because the application plugin is being used, you may directly run the application:

    ./gradlew run

Now point your browser at http://localhost:8080
